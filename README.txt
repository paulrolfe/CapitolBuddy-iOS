About CapitolBuddy
version 1.7.1
http://CapitolBuddy.com

CapitolBuddy is a tool for those that work in their state capitol to manage relationships with legislators. Easily find legislator contact info, biographical info, and take notes for each individual.

State websites are hardly ever mobile friendly and it’s a real pain to carry around a booklet of names and faces. CapitolBuddy puts the legislator data in the palm of your hand and gives you the tools to collaborate with colleagues on your work.

The best way to stay aware of what’s going on with bills you’re working on, is to make sure you have the relationships and connections to be in that loop. That’s what CapitolBuddy helps you build.

Rhode Island is available for your to try the app and see how it can meet your needs. Other states are available for purchase in the app as yearly subscriptions. If you’re in Rhode Island, lucky you!


"It's so easy to get info on legislators as I'm walking to a meeting with them... Helpful to refresh my memory on their staff people and my previous meetings with them."
- PJ Wilson, Renew Missouri

“I was so excited to learn about this app and eager to use it for my work at the State House… Looking forward to using this great resource.”
- Stephanie Geller, Rhode Island Kids Count

“This app has been a great help this year; easy access. I will continue to use instead of hard copy directory in most instances.”
- Norma Collins, AARP


FAQs
* Where does the data come from?
CapitolBuddy uses information publicly available on state government websites. This data is updated as changes are made to the state websites.

* Who is this for?
CapitolBuddy is for anyone working around state capitols, but primarily we have non-profit advocates and lobbyists in mind. Please give it a try if you’re a reporter, legislator, or interested citizen too.

* Is my data available offline?
It sure is! Once you load the app and the legislators once, they are stored locally on your phone (along with your notes), so you can access them even if you have spotty reception in your capitol building.

* Why do I have to pay for my state’s data?
State websites are not as well organized as you may wish. It takes time and effort for us to make this info so presentable and to continue improving our features.

* I want this for my whole team, can I get them all a subscription?
We encourage users to bring everyone in their coalitions, firms, teams, etc. on board with CapitolBuddy. The collaborative note sharing is a huge benefit when sending multiple people to meet with multiple legislators or multiple committees. Contact us for group pricing.
